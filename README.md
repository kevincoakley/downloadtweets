# rehydratoR

This R package facilitates replication of Twitter-based research by providing a convenient function to download lists of tweets.

The input for the package is a list of tweet ID numbers. See [https://archive.org/details/gaza-tweets](https://archive.org/details/gaza-tweets) for an example. 

The output of the package are the tweets downloaded as a [tibble](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tibble) or as JSON files. Examples for both are below.

This package limits the rate of tweet downloading so Twitter's 90,000 tweet/15 minute limit is not exceeded. If you choose to download the tweets to JSON files, then a new JSON file will be created for every 90,000 tweet ID numbers.

Tweets that have been deleted or made private cannot be downloaded.

## Getting Started

Users must acquire a *consumer key*, *consumer secret*, *access token*, and *access token secret* from [https://developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com) on their own.
